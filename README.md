# Recirculation Procedure

The code of a learning procedure for networks which named "Recirculation" using Numpy.
This learning methode described by Geoffrey E. Hinton, and James L. McClelland in 1988.
For more information, you can see the [Paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1987/file/35f4a8d465e6e1edc05f3d8ab658c551-Paper.pdf).



## Dependencies
Python == 3.9.6

Numpy == 1.23.4


## How to run

This code is prepared as object-oriented programming (OOP).
The name of class file is "RecirculationProcedure".
In order to make an instance, you just have to make another .py file and import the class using the command below.

```bash
  from RecirculationProcedure import Recirculation
```
After defining variable, you can make an instance as below.
```bash
  rp = Recirculation(inputs, units_per_layer, number_of_layers, act_func, regression)
```
To make this process easier, I made a main.py file which shows all steps.
